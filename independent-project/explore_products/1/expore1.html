            <h2>Oil Paintings.</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="writting_material">Oil painting is a technique of creating art using pigments mixed with a drying oil, typically linseed oil. It is one of the oldest and most widely used painting techniques in Western art. The use of oil as a binder for pigments allows for a slower drying time, which gives artists more flexibility and control over their work.</p>
        <p class="writting_material">The oldest known oil paintings were created by Buddhist artists in Afghanistan and date back to the 7th century AD.Oil paint was used by Europeans for painting statues and woodwork from at least the 12th century, but its common use for painted images began with Early Netherlandish painting in Northern Europe, and by the height of the Renaissance, oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced the use of egg tempera paints for panel paintings in most of Europe, though not for Orthodox icons or wall paintings, where tempera and fresco, respectively, remained the usual choice.</p>
